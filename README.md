Name - *Diabetes predictor using machine learning*

In our study, we focus on prediction of Diabetes using health

records of the diabetic patients.

By using machine learning techniques, knowledge is acquired

through these records, containing numerical values, to predict

whether the patient is having Diabetes or not.

For this prediction of Diabetes different classification

algorithms (Support Vector Machine, K nearest neighbor,

Logistic Regression) have been used.Machine learning gained a significant position in healthcare

services (HCS) due to its ability to improve the disease prediction in HCS. Machine learning techniques and artificial

intelligence have already been worked in the HCS area. Recently, diabetes is a notable public chronic disease worldwide.It is growing rapidly because of bad lifestyles, taking more junk food and also lake of health awareness. Therefore, there is a need

of framework that can effectively track and monitor people's

diabetes and health condition within an application view.In this study, we proposed a framework for real time diabetes prediction, monitoring and application (DPMA). Our objective is to develop an optimized and efficient machine learning (ML) application which can effectually recognize and predict the condition of the diabetes. In this work, five most important machine learning classification techniques were considered for predicting diabetes.
